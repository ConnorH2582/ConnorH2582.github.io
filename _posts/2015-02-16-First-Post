Hi, thanks for checking out my blog.

My name is Connor, I'm 33, and am a student at ByteAcademy.

I enjoy sports, video games, fitness, crossword puzzles...and coding of course.  

Blogging and creative writing should come easily to me with a bachelor's degree in English, but at the moment, I don't have a whole lot to say...hopefully once I get the blogging process down, I will have something more interesting to talk about in future posts.

Adios for now...
